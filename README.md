# Hangman Game 🎮

A simple **Hangman** game built in `C` for the terminal.

## 📌 How to Play

1. A random word is chosen at the start.
2. The word is hidden with underscores (`_`), showing only its length.
3. The player must guess letters one by one.
4. If the guessed letter is in the word, it replaces the corresponding `_`.
5. If the guessed letter is incorrect, the **Hangman** figure starts forming.
6. The game ends when:
   - The player **guesses the full word** (🎉 Win!).
   - The **Hangman is fully drawn** (💀 Game Over).

## 📌 Rules

- You have **6 attempts** to guess the word.
- Only **single letters (A-Z)** are allowed as input.
- The game is **case-insensitive** (`A` and `a` are treated the same).
- No repeated guesses! Choose wisely.

🎯 **Can you guess the word before it's too late?** 🔥
